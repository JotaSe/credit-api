API using Flask and a predictive model from kaggle data competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit

The API building is inspired on the blogpost https://iamalivingcontradiction.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/how-to-build-a-prediction-api-in-10-minutes-with-flask-swagger-and-scipy/
The predictive model I used it's a Random Forest instead of Naive Bayes, and filling data with median values got me better results that the original post

# Usage
